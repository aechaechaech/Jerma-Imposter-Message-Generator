Generate your very own jerma sus imposter message.


# Modes:

- **Default Mode**: Only supports the characters " ", !, a, b, c, d, e, h, i, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, w and ðŸ˜³
- **Cheater Mode**: Theoretically supports all characters, works by selecting a random slice of jerma's face then writing a letter above it
- **Cypher Mode**: No letters, only barcode. One of the strongest encryption methods on the planet

# Installation
1. Download the `dist.zip` file from the latest release and extract it
2. I think you have to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29) although tbh I'm not sure if this is necesary
3. To run the program, run `main.exe`

# Usage
1. Open up a command prompt/terminal wherever you downloaded the main.py file
2. Run ```python main.py```
3. Enter your message and parameters then watch the freaking magic happen baby

Note: to use "ðŸ˜³" enter ```:flushed:``` into the message input.

# Building
1. Download repository
2. Run ```pip install Pillow py2exe```
3. Run ```python build.py py2exe``` in repository folder
4. Move ```arial.ttf``` and ```imposter.jpg``` into ```dist/```
5. To run the program, run main.exe in ```dist/```
